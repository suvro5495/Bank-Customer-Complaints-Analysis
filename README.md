These reviews and ratings help banks evaluate services provided and take necessary action to improve customer service. While ratings are useful to convey the overall experience, they do not convey the context which led a reviewer to that experience.
If we look at only the rating, it is difficult to guess why the user rated the service as 4 stars. However, after reading the review, it is not difficult to identify that the review talks about good 'service' and 'experience'.
The objetive of the case study is to analyze customer reviews and predict customer satisfaction with the reviews.
